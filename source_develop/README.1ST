      Last Update : 2022-11-22 19:00 UT  (Ver 1.5.0)

------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------
HOW TO INSTALL
-----------------------

1. Install CFITSIO (v 3.48 or later) library as follows. 
   NOTE : The CFITSIO library is not included in this distribution. 
          Get it by yourself via internet.
          (e.g. https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/)

    a: % ./configure
    b: % make
    c: % make install

2. Install GNU Science Library (GSL). There is no problem with GSL-2.5.
   NOTE : The source files are not included in this distribution. 
          Get them by yourself via internet. 

3. Install PGPLOT library. 

4. Uncompress tar-ball with tar command: 

    % tar xvfz aris-1.4.10.tar.gz

   You can see a new directory (aris-1.4.10). This directory is here 
   called $(ARIS). 

5. Now you can compile the simulation program, aris.

    a: % cd aris-1.4.10
    b. % ./configure

6. Edit Makefile if needed. 

7. Run "make".

    a: % make aris


-----------------------
BEFORE USING
-----------------------

You have to copy directories of $(ARIS)/aris_input/ and 
$(ARIS)/aris_log/ to your working directory unless you 
use aris in $ARIS where the executable file exits.


-----------------------
HOW TO USE (MAIN)
-----------------------

    If you succeed the compilation, you can run the simulator as follows: 

% aris

    Or, if you want to run aris with the GUI mode in X-Window system, 
    run aris with -g option.

% aris -g

    In the following, how to use aris in the text user interface mode 
    is described.

    At first, you can see the following message: 


---- ERROR PROC MODE ----
  1  Antenna Position Error
  2  Source-1 Position Error
  3  Source-2 Position Error
  4  EOP Error
  5  Trospospheric Error
  6  Ionospheric Error
  7  Water Vapor Turbulence
  8  Dry Air Turbulence
  9  TEC Turbulence
 10  Thermal Noise Error
 11  Frequency Standard Error
 12  LO Phase Offset
 13  LO Phase Jump (target)
 14  Antenna Gain Bias Error
---- Current ERROR FLAG Status : 00000000000000
Input ERROR FLAG: 


     Select interferometer error sources which you would like to 
     simulate. For instance, if you want to turn off all the error 
     sources, input 0000000000000. If you want to simulate with the 
     Current ERROR FLAG Status, just type RETURN key. If you want to 
     turn on all the error sources, input 1111111111111. If you want 
     to turn on the antenna position error and thermal noise error, 
     input 1000000010000. 


Input ERROR FLAG: 11111111111111
---- New ERROR FLAG Status : 11111111111111
Which input type for the source positions?
1. R.A.       -   DEC.
2. Delta_R.A. -   Delta_DEC.
3. Sep_ang    -   P.A.
(CR->1)
Input number: 


    Select one number to input the positions of a pair of 
    sources. Since ARIS simulates phase-referencing observations, 
    you need to input two source positions. If you don't intend to 
    perform a phase-referencing observation, input the same position 
    of the first source as the second. 

    For example, if you select "1", you input R.A and Decl for each 
    of the sources. We here give you an example when you select "2".


Which position for the input?
1. Source-1 Position
2. MID Point
(CR->1)
Input number: 


    Select the number. If you select "1", input the position of one 
    of the sources. If you select "2", input the center position 
    between the two sources. We assume that you take the number 1.


**** Source-1 (J2000) ****
Input RA (CR->18 03 00.0) : 

    Input the right ascension of source-1 in the format of 
    "hh mm ss.ss". 

Input DEC(CR->59 00 00.0) : 

    Input the declination of source-1 in the format of 
    "dd mm ss.ss". If the declination is below zero, 
    you input the position using the format as "-dd mm ss.s". 


Input RA (CR->02 00 00.0) : 02 00 00                  -> hh mm ss
Input DEC(CR->60 00 00.0) : 60 00 00                  -> dd mm ss
Separation Angle (RA) [deg] (CR->2.0) : 

    Input the separation angle between the sources. If you don't 
    need the phase-referencing, input 0 for R.A. and DEC. 

Separation Angle (RA) [deg] (CR->2.000000) : 2
Separation Angle (DC) [deg] (CR->1.000000) : 1
Separation Angle [deg]: 2.236045
Input Observation Date [YYYYMMDD] (CR->20101121) : 20101121

    Input the observation date when the simulatioted observation 
    will start. 

Input Start UTC (hhmmss) (CR->060000) : 060000

    Input the start UTC time. 


Observing Duration [hour] (CR->8.000000) : 8

    Input the observation duration. 

GRT MINIMUM elevation (CR->20 [deg]) : 20

    Input the minimum elevation angle of the telescopes which 
    attend the simulated observation. If you set too low elevation 
    angle, the simulation may not work with the error option of 
    ``Water Vapor Turbulence" and/or ``TEC Turbulence". We recommend 
    to use an elevation angle higher than 10-15 degrees. 

    Then, you can see the following messages:

ARIS starts....
REF Position Shift [sec] : (RA, Dec)=(-0.000007453,  0.000008554)
TGT Position Shift [sec] : (RA, Dec)=(-0.000007422,  0.000008581)

    If you have selected the error source of ``Reference Position 
    Error", the minor position shift is added to the reference 
    source. The quantity is ramdomly selected. Target position 
    is not changed while the position shift of the reference 
    source occurs. ARIS just shows the prediction of the apparent 
    position shift of the target source in the case that the 
    reference position is not correct. 

    If you have selected the error source of the TROPOSPHERIC 
    disturbance, the phase-screen simlation starts. It takes 
    a few minutes, depending on the observing duration and 
    CPU power.

HOW TO USE (PHASE SCREEN GENERATION)
-----------------------

    Run aris with -g option working in X-Window system, 

% aris -g

    In the lower half side, you can find four buttons of "START", 
    "ANTENNA VISIBILITY", "PHASE SCREEN", and "EXIT". Click 
    "PHASE SCREEN" in order to generate atmospheric phase screens. 

    Then you can see a parametger input windows. Please input your 
    preferable parameters for your purpose. 

    - Inner Scale [m]
    It is considered that the atmospheric turbulence has two regions: 
    3-dimensional and 2-dimensional turbulences for smaller and 
    larger spatial scales, respectively. Inner Scale is a horizontal 
    length of a border between the 3-d and 2-d scales. This should 
    be a perfect power of the 2^M multiplied by "Pixel Size".

    - Outer Scale [m]
    Outer Scale is a horizontal length over which the 2-d turbulence 
    no more develops. This shoud be greater than Inner Scale and 
    2^N multiplied by "Pixel Size". (N > M)

    - Inner Exponent
    Structure exponent of the spatial structure function of the 
    inner (3-d) atmospheric phase fluctuations.

    - Outer Exponent
    Structure exponent of the spatial structure function of the 
    outer (2-d) atmospheric phase fluctuations.

    - Pixel Size [m]
    A scale of the single pixel of the screen. In other words, 
    spatial resolution of the phase screen.

    - Width (x) [m]
    The full length of the 2-dimensional phase screen.

    - Width (y) [m]
    The full length of the 2-dimensional phase screen. "Width (y)" should 
    not be smaller than "Width (x)".

    - RMS Value
    Root mean square of the fluctuation for the horizaontal scale 
    of "Baseline Length".

    - Baseline length [m]
    Horizontal length in setting "RMS".

    - BIAS
    Offset value or expectation over the 2-d screen.

    - Save File Name
    Preferable file name for saving the result.

    - Screen generation mode   (Single screen / Multi screen)
    If "Single screen" is selected, ARIS calculates a single phase screen 
    with Wsdth (x) x Width (y). If "Multi screen" is selected, ARIS 
    generates a number of the screens devided by an adjycent length 
    along y-axis.


    In the bottom, there are three buttons: "DISPLAY SCNREEN", "SAVE", and 
    "Return". 

    If you set all the parameters above, just click "SAVE". If you click 
    "Return", ARIS moves back to show the primary menu window.

    "DISPLAY SCREEN" button is for visial comfirmation of the 
    generated screen. This does not affect the calculation result.

  * A bug in ver 1.2.6 causing a segmentation error under the pgplot 
    graphical mode was fixed. 
  * A very primitive ``configure" file was newly generated. 

2010-08-31 06:00 UT  (Ver 1.2.8)
  * Timezone structure in seed_random.c has been commented out because 
    it is too old to be taken care of. 

2010-10-19 13:00 UT  (Ver 1.2.9)
  * KVN antenna parameters were revised. 
  * Bugs included in get_vis, ccm_read, imager were fixed.

  * L-O (Local Oscillator) Phase offset has a option for the local 
    oscillator phase at each of the frequency bands for each of the 
    stations. Stantion-dependent clock offsets and its drifts are 
    not turned on with L-O Phase offset. Those are turned on when 
    a new function of error, ``Frequency Standard Error'', is 
    turned on. 
  * Frequency Standard error can simulate the frequency instabilities 
    of Hydrogen masers and Cryocooled Capphaire Oscillators (10MHz and 
    100MHz reference signal) based on Nant et al. (2011). If you 
    want to try the H-maser simulation, set ``H_M'' to ant_prm.FRQSTD 
    of a specified antenna in array_config.c. For the cryoCSO 10-MHz 
    and 100-MHz signals, you set CSO_10 and CSO_100, respectively. 
    station 
  * ``Very Good'' tropospheric condition was added. This option has 
    a 50-percentile tropospheric condition at Chajonantor measured 
    with site-test radio seeing monitors: 100 micorn RMS in EPL with 
    a 100-m baseline. 
  * Source position selection was added in the observation condition menu.
  * A smooth display for source structures has been added. 
  * CC component reading subrotine has a bug when the list has a 
    large number of CC components. The bug was fixed. 
  * visibility_calc, pgcont_map, pg_color_map have been revised. 
  * tracking_status was modified, though it doen not have a bug. 
  * BUG fix in calculating the thermal noise for space antennas in 
    uvw_calc. 
  * Frequebcy of BAND 5, 6, 7, 8 of ALMA was added. 
  * Frequency band width of 1024 MHz was added. 
  * Source position calculation function has a bug: the sign of the 
    position angle was opsite. Fixed. 

2012-01-17 07:00 UT  (Ver 1.3.1)
  * Minor changes for several source codes. 
  * Allan standard deviation had benn shown in a fixed dynamic range 
    for y-axis. It can be shown in the dynamical dynamic range. 

2012-01-19 14:00 UT  (Ver 1.3.2)
  * Since there is a serious bug in uvw_calc.c in calculating fringe 
    errors due to errors in EOP, antenna positions, and source positions. 
    There had been the bug since version 1.3.0. Fixed. 

2012-01-20 08:00 UT  (Ver 1.3.3)
  * Wavelengths can be set by user in aris_input/fixed_parameter.prm. 

2012-01-22 02:00 UT  (Ver 1.3.4)
  * On graphical user I/F mode, you can confirm the observing 
    frequency which is calculeted based on fixed_parameter.prm 
    if a button is changed to ON. 

2012-02-07 10:00 UT  (Ver 1.3.5)
  * The source position of Source-2 had been written in the calibrator 
    FITS file even if Source-1 is selected. This bug was fixed. 
  * Antenna parameter file (aris_input/antenna.prm) was prepared for 
    users to set their preference freely. 

2012-02-08 16:00 UT  (Ver 1.3.6)
  * A bug causing the wrong thermal noise calculation was removed. 

2012-02-23 09:00 UT  (Ver 1.3.7)
  * In the previous versions, there have been several bugs which 
    make the performance unstable. It was found that the biggest 
    problem was to address pointers which are not allocated. 
    Not all but several sub-programs related to calculations of 
    a pair of source positions and the parameter input section 
    were checked carefully. It seems that the performance is more 
    stable than ever. 
  * Bugs causing troubles in calculating tropospheric delays were 
    fixed. Those have been made since ver 1.3.5, the antenna selection 
    sub-programs were replaced. Because the elevation limit did not 
    work, uvw_calc calculated the mapping function at the very low 
    elevation including zero. 

2012-04-02 03:00 UT  (Ver 1.3.8)
  * Antenna code character had not been correctly processed because 
    the NULL character had not been set at the end of the string. 
  * Source position could not be processed correctly. The bug was 
    fixed. 

2012-09-10 17:00 UT  (Ver 1.3.9)
  * When the source position input is the source1-source2 mode, the 
    separation angle, Delta RA, and Delta Dec were not calculated. 
    This bug has existed since Version 1.3.7. Fixed. 
  * WVR phase correction mode is added. 
    - ALMA 50-percentile condition: RMS path length fluxtuation of 100 
      micron for a 100-m baseline length with the structure exponent of 5/3.
    - Structure coefficient: 30-% amplitude comparing with the ALMA 
      50-percentile condition. 
    - Structure exponent   : the same as the Kolmogorov turbulence.
  * src/astrotools/MJD.c had had a bug in calculating leap days. 
    Fixed.
